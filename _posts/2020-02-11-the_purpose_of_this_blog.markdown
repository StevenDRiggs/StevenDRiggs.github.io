I love coding. I love learning and teaching. I see way too often people stuck and unable to truly learn how to code because they get stuck on the basics. More often than not, it seems what people get the most confused about is the terminology.

Face it, we developers have a language of our own, and I'm not talking about which programming language you're coding in.

In other words, the point of this blog is to explain in the simplest, most easy-to-understand terms what all the coding tutorials are talking about, and more importantly, **how it applies to the real world (of coding).**

So follow along, and I will do my best to make sure you can do your best at learning to code, without spinning your wheels on things that most developers with any amount of time in the industry assume you already know.

*You can't know what you don't know until you find out that you don't know it.*


# Why I decided to learn Software Engineering
I've always had an interest in coding, but I never realized how much until recently. At one of my previous jobs, I had a lot of down time with no access to any form of entertainment. At the time, my wife and I were playing a game that included its own scripting language built in for customizing the game. During the aforementioned down time, I would hand write code for that game to pass the time. I didn't think any further about it.

Fast forward several years, and I found all my old hand-written code. I had filled up **eight** notebooks, *front and back!* At that point I realized that if I could *hand write* \*that\* much code, then I must truly love this stuff. While searching for a job during a long period of unemployment, I started teaching myself Python. And I was right. I love this stuff.

So now, after three years at a job that doesn't thrill me, it is finally time for me to follow this passion and see this whole thing through.
