I love coding. I love learning and teaching. I see way too often people stuck and unable to truly learn how to code because they get stuck on the basics. More often than not, it seems what people get the most confused about is the terminology.

Face it, we developers have a language of our own, and I'm not talking about which programming language you're coding in.

In other words, the point of this blog is to explain in the simplest, most easy-to-understand terms what all the coding tutorials are talking about, and more importantly, **how it applies to the real world (of coding).**

So follow along, and I will do my best to make sure you can do your best at learning to code, without spinning your wheels on things that most developers with any amount of time in the industry assume you already know.

*You can't know what you don't know until you find out that you don't know it.*
