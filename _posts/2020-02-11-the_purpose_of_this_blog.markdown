I've always had an interest in coding, but I never realized how much until recently. At one of my previous jobs, I had a lot of down time with no access to any form of entertainment. At the time, my wife and I were playing a game that included its own scripting language built in for customizing the game. During the aforementioned down time, I would hand write code for that game to pass the time. I didn't think any further about it. Fast forward several years, and I found all my old hand-written code. I had filled up **eight** notebooks, *front and back!* At that point I realized that if I could *hand write* \*that\* much code, then I must truly love this stuff. While searching for a job during a long period of unemployment, I started teaching myself Python. And I was right. I love this stuff. So now, after three years at a job that doesn't thrill me, it is finally time for me to follow this passion and see this whole thing through.
