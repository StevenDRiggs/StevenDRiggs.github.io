This project has been a hard one. The first and largest lesson I learned was to never start your project until you at least have a clear idea of how you want it to flow. I restarted this project twice because I had written myself into a corner and then realized I wanted it to go in a different direction. The second lesson I learned was to allow at least as much time for UX/UI design as for coding functionality. I have had a lot of fun, though. I am learning how to incorporate SVG animations in, which could be a course on its own. I do like how XML such as SVG can simply be inserted directly into ReactJS with no major alterations. I also finally understand the difference between class-based components and functional components: you really only ever need class-based if you are tracking local state or need a lifecycle function like componentDidMount. Other than that, you can use the simpler functional components, even if you are connecting to Redux.
