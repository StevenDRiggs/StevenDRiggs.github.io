This project was a great, fascinating learning experience. This is the largest project I have ever completed (with 50 pages!) and therefore took a LOT of time and contained many mistake along the way.

I definitely learned that establihing your structure, not only of your database but also of you web pages' flow, early on makes the entire process MUCH smoother. Unfortuantely, I discovered this by having to go back and restructure the webpages' flow partway through.

I also discovered how important it is to read the project requirements several times, and check back with them periodically. I forgot to include privacy for individual user data, and had to tweak every single url annd view to add it in later.

Overall, an amazing project, and I look forward to using it for my daily life.
