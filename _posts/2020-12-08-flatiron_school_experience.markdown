This school has been amazing. It has been challenging. It has been frustrating. Most of all, it has been worth it. I started in February with several years of self-taught training under my belt, and zero professional experience. I knew I could code. What I didn't know was whether I could cut in the professional world. 7000 (it seems) modules and labs later, I am certain. I will have multiple professional coding jobs in the coming future. I will almost certainly work from home during large parts of that future. I will probabbly freelance at some point. Most of all, I will succed at it. Not only succeed, but thrive. I am a software developer. I am ready. To all the staff, both visible and behind-the-scenes, thank you. You have not only trained me in a plethora of skills, both hard and soft, that I will be able to use for the rest of my life; you have given me the confidence I needed to know that this field is for me, and I for it. I can't honestly say one module was harder or easier than any other, because each one (even Ruby, whch is so similar to the Python I already knew) has challenged me in ways I never imagined, and embedded deep knowledge and understanding of the concepts presented. As such, I have learned to love languages I previously could not stand (Ruby, JavaScript) or which sounded like an alien language to me at first (Redux). Third only to God and marriage, this school is by far the best investment I have ever made.
